I am a PhD student in the Department of Sociology at the University of Washington.
My primary research focuses on how characteristics of neighborhoods impact crime and social control.
I approach this topic with methods from demography, computational social science, and 
causal inference. I also teach programming for data analysis with R and quantitative 
research methods. I am a committed advocate for reproducible research.
