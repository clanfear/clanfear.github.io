I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Centre for Social Investigation in Oxford's Nuffield College.
My primary research focuses on how characteristics of communities impact crime and social control.
I approach this topic with methods from demography, computational social science, and
causal inference. I also teach courses and workshops on programming for data analysis with R and quantitative
research methods. I am a committed advocate for reproducible research, and all my course and workshop materials are open access via this website and my [GitHub account](https://github.com/clanfear).
