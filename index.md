I am an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Criminology in the University of
Cambridge. My primary research focuses on how crime, victimization, and social
control are related to large-scale changes in communities and society as a
whole. I approach this topic with methods from demography, computational social
science, and causal inference. I also teach courses and workshops on programming
for data analysis with R, research design, and quantitative methods. I am a
committed advocate for reproducible research, and all my course and workshop
materials are open access via this website and my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/clanfear).
