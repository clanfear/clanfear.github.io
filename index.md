I am an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Criminology in the University of Cambridge.
My primary research focuses on how characteristics of communities impact crime, victimization, and social control.
I approach this topic with methods from demography, computational social science, and
causal inference. I also teach courses and workshops on programming for data analysis with R, research design, and quantitative methods. I am a committed advocate for reproducible research, and all my course and workshop materials are open access via this website and my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/clanfear). 

[See my CV for my research and teaching.](https://clanfear.github.io/ccl_cv/cv_clean/cv_clean.html)
